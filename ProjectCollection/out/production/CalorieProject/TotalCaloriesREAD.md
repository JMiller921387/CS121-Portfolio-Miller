The total calories script is meant to help you calculate the total amount of calories you will eat on a diet.

It does this through asking the calories you will eat in a day, and the start and end dates of the diet.

The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with dates and times in java.

The hardest part of this project was editing this script to add more functions I wanted, like daysLong, to improve its main purpose, as well as improve it's finctionality with scripts in upcoming projects.
