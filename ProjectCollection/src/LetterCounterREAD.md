The purpose of this project is to count the occurances of a certain letter in a certain word

This project was made to help give a practical application of linear search.

I edited this project to make it more flexible to any word and any letter. 

The hardest part was when I edited this project. I had to understand how characters and strings differ, and how you can convert the two. eventually I took a step back, tried a different workaround as opposed to sheer conversion (like String.tochar), and it worked!
