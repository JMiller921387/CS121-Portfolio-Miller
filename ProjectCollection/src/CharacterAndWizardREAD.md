THe purpose of the Character and Wizard files is to create a character for a DND campaign, or any general role-playing game.
The wizard class is meant to extend the basic outline of the character file, to have the basic abilities of a character and a few specialities of a wizard.

The purpose of this project is to get me familiar with extending clases.

I updated the scripts to tell the user the status of their character (and wizard), when needed, using format statements, that were unfamiliar to me until the end of this class.

The hardest part of this project was grasping with the idea of how classes extend themselves. Once I understood the concept, I was able to execute this project with general ease.
