THe purpose of the Character and Wizard files is to create a character for a DND campaign, or any general role-playing game.
The wizard class is meant to extend the basic outline of the character file, to have the basic abilities of a character and a few specialities of a wizard.

The purpose of this project is to get me familiar with extending clases.

The hardest part of this project was grasping with the idea of how classes extend themselves. Once I understood the concept, I was able to execute this project with general ease.
